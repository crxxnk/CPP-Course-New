Looping

Looping, iteration or repetition is the third basic building block of programming.
It allows the execution of a statement or a block of statements repeatedly.
Loops are made up of a loop condition and the body which contains the statements to repeat.

Typical use cases for loops:

Execute a loop:
  * a specific number of times
  * for each element in a collection
  * while a specific condition remains true
  * until a specific condition becomes false
  * until we reach the end of some input stream
  * forever
  * many, many more

C++ Looping Constructs
   * for loop
      * iterate a specific number of times

   * Range-based for loop
      * one iteration for each element in a range or collection

   * while loop
      * iterate while a condition remains true
      * stop when the condition becomes false
      * check the condition at the beginning of every iteration

   * do-while loop
      * iterate while a condition remains true
      * stop when the condition becomes false
      * check the condition at the end of every iteration
