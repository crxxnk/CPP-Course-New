  //! Constants
  //* Constants are values that can't be changed once they are declared.
  //* They are declared with the const keyword.
  //? Types of constants:
  //* Literals are values such as numbers, characters, strings whose values are self-explained.
  //? For example: 20 is a literal. We know that 20 means 20 and is an int. 'A' is also a literal for the same reason.
  //* - Declared constants, const name
  // const double pi = 3.14159;
  //* - Constant expressions, constexpr name
  //* - Enumerated constants, enum name
  //* - Defined constants, #define
  //! Don't use defined constants in modern c++
  //? #define pi 3.14159(it tells the preprocessor that wherever it sees the word pi to replace it with 3.14159)
